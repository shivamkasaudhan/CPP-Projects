"Atomic Habits," written by James Clear, emphasizes the transformative power of small, incremental changes in our daily routines. 
Rather than focusing on grand, sweeping actions, Clear argues that it's the tiny, consistent adjustments we make every day that 
culminate in significant life changes over time. By analyzing the habits from a systems perspective and underscoring the importance 
of identity-based habits, the book provides readers with actionable strategies to eliminate bad habits and cultivate good ones, 
ensuring long-term growth and success.
